The output generated by the ff solver shows that we can create an x who is his own granduncle in five steps. 

First, P1 and P2 give birth to a daughter, P5. Then, P2 and P5 give birth to a daughter, P4. Next, P2 and P4 give birth to a son, P5. 

We then conclude that P3 and P5 are siblings because they are both children of P2. We can further conclude that P3 is P4's uncle. This is because P3 is P5's brother and P4 is the daughter of P5. 

Because P3 is P4's uncle and P4 is P3's mother, we can conclude that P3 is his own granduncle. 

The solver finds this path very quickly, in less than 0.01 seconds on a machine in the Teer lab.
